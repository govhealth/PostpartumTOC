    "description": "The MH TOC Breastfeeding Intent Profile is derived from the US Core Simple Observation Profile. This profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource for querying an individualâ€™s breastfeeding intention of their newborn during or after the postpartum period. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.  It defines requirements for exchanging the documented breastfeeding intent which is commonly recorded during prenatal care or directly postpartum during the delivery hospitalization.",
