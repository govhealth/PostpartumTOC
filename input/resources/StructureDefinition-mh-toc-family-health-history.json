  "description": "This profile sets minimum expectations for the FamilyMemberHistory resource for querying a pregnant individual’s family health history. In this profile, family member history is focused particularly on relevant family health conditions. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases. /n The MH TOC Family Health History profile leverages the base FHIR R4 FamilyMemberHistory resource and modifies it to include the capture of relevant family health conditions. It defines additional constraints, terminology, and bindings for standardized representation of the patient’s family health history.",
