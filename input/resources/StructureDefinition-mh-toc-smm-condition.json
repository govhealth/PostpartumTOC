    "description": “This profile sets minimum expectations for the Condition resource, which provides guidance on querying for a patient’s documented Severe Maternal Morbidity indicator(s). The MH TOC Severe Maternal Morbidity Condition profile leverages the US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile and modifies it to support the CDC-identified (21 Severe Maternal Morbidity indicator(s))[ https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/php/severe-maternal-morbidity/icd.html]. As defined by CDC, Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that can result in significant short- or long-term health consequences. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases. /n It defines the common requirements for representing groups of diagnoses and their constituent mappings to a single Severe Maternal Morbidity Indicator.  For examples, please see the instances of the individual derivative profiles.”,
