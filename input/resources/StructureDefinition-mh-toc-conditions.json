    "description": "This profile sets minimum expectations for the MH TOC Conditions resource, which provides guidance on querying for a patient’s documented conditions that are relevant for postpartum clinical care, including events during the antepartum period and the delivery event. The MH TOC Conditions profile leverages the US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile and modifies it to support identified relevant conditions. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.",
