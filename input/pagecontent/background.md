### USCDI+ Maternal Health Domain Overview
With increasing rates of maternal mortality for pregnant women and new mothers, it is paramount that providers, across care settings, have access to reliable and accurate health data to inform their treatment and interventions. However, current gaps in standardized, interoperable data to exchange across health care settings can limit providers’ ability to access necessary health data to effectively manage and deliver high-quality care.  

To promote standardized data capture and exchange, ASTP developed and maintains USCDI core data elements, organized by class, that are supported by certified health IT solutions. In addition, ASTP created USCDI+ domains to serve specific programmatic, clinical, research, public health, or other requirements. The USCDI+ MH domain extends the USCDI core dataset by establishing maternal health specific data elements for use in delivering care and conducting research on health outcomes for pregnant women.  

### USCDI+ Maternal Health Use Case: Postpartum Transitions of Care
A study of pregnancy-related deaths that occurred between 2017 and 2019 found that 12% occurred one to six days after delivery, 23% occurred between 7 to 42 days after delivery, and 30% occurred between 43 and 365 days after delivery. In 2022, the maternal mortality rate in the United States was 22.3 deaths per 100,000 live births, significantly higher than rates in other high-income countries. This elevated rate underscores the ongoing challenges in maternal health within the U.S. healthcare system.

In the United States, maternity care involves transitions across multiple healthcare settings, each with distinct providers and systems. Prenatal care typically occurs in outpatient clinics, where obstetricians, midwives, or family physicians monitor the pregnancy through regular visits. When labor begins, care shifts to a hospital or birthing center, where a different team manages the delivery. After childbirth, the mother returns to outpatient care for postpartum follow-up. 

This fragmented system can hinder the seamless sharing of clinical information. For instance, outpatient providers may lack immediate access to detailed records from the hospital stay, such as delivery complications or interventions. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) emphasizes the importance of coordinated care, advocating for a continuous individualized process rather than a single encounter. ACOG recommends that all women have contact with their obstetric care providers within the first three weeks postpartum, followed by a comprehensive visit no later than 12 weeks after birth. However, researchers have found that the number of women who have postpartum care visits ranges significantly, depending on their insurance coverage and other demographic factors.5 Effective communication and data sharing across these settings are crucial to address ongoing health needs, manage chronic conditions, and support the mother's transition to primary care. 

This approach addresses the critical need for coordinated clinical information across care settings. Timely follow-up enables healthcare providers to manage chronic conditions, assess mental health, and support infant care and feeding. Moreover, it facilitates the transition from obstetric to primary care, ensuring continuity and comprehensiveness in a woman's health journey.  

The Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), funded by HRSA, began developing and disseminating maternal safety bundles in 2015 to improve outcomes across the perinatal spectrum. Among the six priority use cases identified, postpartum care was recognized as critical, leading to the revision of the Postpartum Discharge Transition Patient Safety Bundle in 2021, which outlines evidence-based practices to enhance care transitions and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. 

While many resources and AIM Bundles provide resources to support postpartum transitions of care, the ASTP USCDI+ MH Postpartum Transition of Care Use Case focuses specifically on interoperable data exchange between health IT solutions that support obstetric care providers in caring for pregnant and postpartum patients and associated federal quality and reporting programs with electronic measures and datasets pertaining to postpartum outcomes.  

Given the concentration of deaths that occur in the postpartum period, it is critical to support providers who care for patients in this stage by equipping them with the necessary information from antepartum (before birth) and intrapartum (during birth) period. however, gaps in standardized and interoperable data exchange between health IT systems prevent care providers from access to the most up to date and accurate care information necessary to provide effective and safe postpartum care. 

### Data Exchange: Current State
Two critical factors in postpartum care are the capture and exchange of postpartum-relevant data elements with providers, many of whom practice in ambulatory settings. When data is available, it is often incomplete or of insufficient quality to be effectively incorporated and used. This issue partly stems from limited support and a lack of standardized approaches for capturing postpartum data, which are essential for interoperable data exchange. 

Currently, the most widely used standards to exchange maternal health data are: 
- Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDAs) – formats for exchanging structured data and narrative in a document form that is often generated to represent a patient encounter and contains structured and unstructured data, such as notes (e.g., Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs), Discharge Summary, History & Physical notes, and Encounter Summary);  
- HL7 Admit, Transfer, and Discharge messages (ADTs) – message type used to communicate information about an inpatient encounter, such as the patient’s diagnosis, the type of event, insurance information, and other details; and 
- Paper-Based Records – format for exchanging information to postpartum providers either in-person or via fax.  

Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has not yet been widely adopted for maternal health data exchange. Although some support exists—such as through the ASTP United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) and the HL7 FHIR US Core Implementation Guide (US Core FHIR IG)—its application to postpartum use cases remains limited. Major barriers include the absence of a standardized set of postpartum data elements and a lack of guidance on appropriate value sets. Addressing these gaps would reduce the burden on data users—both providers and third-party entities such as researchers—by establishing clear parameters for data capture, exchange, and interpretation. Providers would benefit from having specific implementation guidance for mapping their EHR’s data dictionary to specified values for identified data elements. Third-party users would benefit from understanding data elements supported for exchange and query-able values for data elements of interest. 

### Data Exchange: Future State and Proposed Vision
These data standards and formats represent the current baseline for documenting and exchanging postpartum data within the existing health IT landscape. To better support postpartum care and improve maternal health outcomes, it is critical for the USCDI+ Maternal Health (MH) domain not only to develop new implementation guidance, but also to account for existing data formats and exchange mechanisms. Doing so will help ensure timely and interoperable data sharing among all postpartum providers. 

Key considerations include, but are not limited to: 
- Interoperability between currently used data format (e.g., CDA) and data exchange (e.g., SFTP) standards and HL7 FHIR; 
- Health IT capacity at data exchange partners (e.g., health systems, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), mental and behavioral health providers, lactation consultants, at-home providers) especially for data exchange partners with non-enterprise level EHRs;  
- Clinical workflows and data captured at the time of pregnancy outcome events(e.g., delivery); 
- Format and structure of documented data; and 
- Custom and/or site-specific data dictionaries.  

This presents an opportunity for the USCDI+ MH domain to develop HL7 FHIR implementation guidance for the Postpartum Transition of Care Use Case. Such guidance would specify the relevant postpartum data elements and value sets, enabling the capture and exchange of structured—and potentially codified—postpartum data. This standardization supports emerging health IT use cases in postpartum care, including remote patient monitoring, clinical decision support, and third-party mobile applications.
