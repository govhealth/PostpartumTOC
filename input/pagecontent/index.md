### Introduction

The United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Plus Maternal Health (USCDI+ Maternal Health) is an extension of the USCDI, created to address crucial gaps in electronic health data standards supporting maternal and postpartum health. The USCDI+ Postpartum Transition of Care (TOC) aims to standardize and enhance electronic information exchange during the transition from delivery to postpartum care and primary care, addressing the fragmentation that commonly affects postpartum individuals as they transition between different providers and care settings


### Scope and boundaries

Why This Guide Uses US Core

This Implementation Guide builds upon the US Core Implementation Guide (v6.1.0) wherever possible to ensure alignment with national interoperability standards and regulatory requirements. US Core defines standardized FHIR profiles for data elements required by the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), which is the foundation for certified health IT exchange under the 21st Century Cures Act.

By using US Core profiles:
	•	We ensure compatibility with ONC-certified health IT systems
	•	We support interoperable data exchange across clinical systems, public health agencies, and care teams
	•	We minimize the need for custom development by adopting widely implemented FHIR patterns
	•	We align with federal expectations for structured data sharing

USCDI defines what data must be shared (e.g., conditions, medications, observations), and US Core provides the FHIR profiles for how that data should be structured and exchanged. This guide builds on those profiles and extends them only when postpartum-specific needs go beyond USCDI’s current scope.

In this way, the guide maximizes reuse of national standards while addressing unique data elements relevant to maternal and postpartum care.
