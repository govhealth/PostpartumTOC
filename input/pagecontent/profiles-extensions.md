The following profiles and extensions are defined for the USCDI+ Maternal Health Postpartum TOC Implementation Guide. This implementation guide's profiles and extensions are in addition to those defined by US Core 6.1.0. Implementers **SHALL** reference the [US Core Profiles and Extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/profiles-and-extensions.html) page to ensure all profiles and extensions are fully and properly implemented. For more information regarding the resources upon which these are built please refer to the [FHIR specification](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).
