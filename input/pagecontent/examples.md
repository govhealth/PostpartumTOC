**Examples for Mother-Child relationship**
Creating linkages between the mother and child is critical to the use case for Maternal Health Postpartum Transitions of Care (MH TOC) since this linkage is generally created created during the delivery encounter. This linkage is established using the [Patient](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html) and [RelatedPerson](http://hl7.org/fhir/relatedperson.html) resources. Examples of relating mother and child are shown below which conform to [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/index.html) which is strongly recommended in the IG. For thorough documentation please reference the [Longitudinal Maternal & Infant Health Information for Research Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mmm-ig/index.html).
