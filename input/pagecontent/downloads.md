### Package File

The following package file includes all value sets, profiles, extensions, webpages, and URLs in the IG, defined as part of this version of the implementation guide. This file **SHOULD** be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts since it contains all the rules about what makes the profiles valid. Implementers must be familiar with the specification content and profiles that apply to create a conformant implementation. See the validating profiles and resources documentation in FHIR (accessible via the [Specifications tabs](spec.md)) for more information.
