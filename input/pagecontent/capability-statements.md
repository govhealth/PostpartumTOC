### Client Capabilities


This Section describes the expected capabilities of the Maternal Health Postpartum Transition Client which is responsible for creating and initiating the queries for information about an individual patient, their encounters, procedures, etc. The list of profiles, RESTful operations, and search parameters supported by the MH TOC Servers are defined in the Conformance Requirements for Server. Clients have the option of choosing from this list to access necessary data based on their local implementations, data mapping and availability and other contextual requirements. While this IG does not define its own Client capability statement, implementers of clients **SHALL** refer to [US Core 6.1.0 Client CapabilityStatement](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/CapabilityStatement-us-core-client.html) for details and ensure conformance to those expectations.
